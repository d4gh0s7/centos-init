# CentOS Docker
Init shell script for a basic CentOS Docker node, fairly hardened and *almost* production ready.

"Assume every network you're on is malicious"
							- Samy Kamar

## Install the script

Get the script and execute it as shown:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d4gh0s7/centos-init/master/init-docker.sh
sudo chmod +x init-docker.sh
sudo ./init-docker.sh
```
## Post Install todos
This script is meant ti initialize a specific environment. Remember to log into your freshly carded instance and do the proper hardening, otherwise... 
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

/dev/null before dishonour
```
